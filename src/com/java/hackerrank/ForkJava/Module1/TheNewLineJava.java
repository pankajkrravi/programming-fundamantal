You are familiar with producing output using JAVA In this task, you'll be required to write three messages in three separate lines. Write Geeks for Geeks. But wait a minute!! You need to write each word of it in a separate line.
In the function printIndividualLine(), output each word of Geeks for Geeks in a separate line.
Hint: System.out.println() might be useful here!

Example:

Input:
No input

Output:
Geeks
for
Geeks

Explanation:
First word of the statment is in first line,
next word is in next line and last is in las
 */
public class TheNewLineJava {
    // Function to print each word in single line
    static void printIndividualLine(){
        // Your code here
    System.out.println("Geeks");
    System.out.println("for");
    System.out.println("Geeks");
    }
}
