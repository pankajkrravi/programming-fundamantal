Given two arrays pages and words of size n. The array of pages contains the page numbers and array of words contains n words. You have to map each word corresponding to its page number and you need to find the word that is mapped to page number x. If there is no word on x, print null.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains T denoting thr number of testcases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains 2 lines of input. The first line contains the number of words n and x. The second line contains the n  page numbers separated by space. The third line contains n words separated by space. The ith index of word array corresponds to ith index of page numbers array. .

Output Format:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the required answer.

Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the function Dictionary().

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= n <= 1000

Examples:
1
5 600
123 345 456 500 550

Output:
null

Explanation:
Testcase1:
There is no word in the dictionary at page number 600 so it prints null.

 */
public class Dictionary {
    // print the word corresponding to page
    // number pg
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public static void Dictionary(int pages[], String words[], int pg) {
        // Your code here

    }
}
