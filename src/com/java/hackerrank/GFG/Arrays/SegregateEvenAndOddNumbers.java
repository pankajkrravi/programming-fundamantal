 * Given an array Arr[], write a program that segregates even and odd numbers. The program should put all even numbers first in sorted order, and then odd numbers in sorted order.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * N = 7
 * Arr[] = {12, 34, 45, 9, 8, 90, 3}
 * Output: 8 12 34 90 3 9 45
 * Explanation: Even numbers are 12, 34,
 * 8 and 90. Rest are odd numbers. After
 * sorting even numbers 8 12 34 90 and
 * after sorting odd numbers 3 9 45. Then
 * concat both.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * N = 5
 * Arr[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
 * Output: 0 2 4 1 3
 * Explanation: 0 2 4 are even and 1 3
 * are odd numbers.
 * Your Task:
 * You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function segregateEvenOdd() which takes the array of integers arr[] and n as parameters and returns void. You need to modify the array itself.
