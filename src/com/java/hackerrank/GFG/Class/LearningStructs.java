Structures are very useful when we want to create Linked Lists and Trees. Here we will learn to create a Linked List struct.

You have to make struct for Linked List.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Linked List => 1 2 3 4 5
Output:
5
Explanation:
1->2->3->4->5->NULL is the linked
list formed. The length is 5
Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the provided struct. All the other functions of the linked-list are already implemented. Driver code will print the length of the linked list.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100
