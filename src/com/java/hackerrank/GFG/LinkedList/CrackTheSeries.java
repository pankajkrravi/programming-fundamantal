Given the series as follows 2 2 4 8 16 512....... Identify the Nth term of the series. Answers can be very large use BigInt in Java.

Example 1:

Input: N = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: First term of the series is 2.
Example 2:

Input: N = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Second term of the series is 2.


Your Task:
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function NthTerm() which takes N as input parameter and returns the Nth term of the series.

Expected Time Complexity: O(logn*logn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1<= N <=12

    /*static BigInteger NthTerm(int N){
        // code here
        BigInteger double Nterm = 0;
        int a = N/2;
        if(N%2==0)
            Nterm = Math.pow(2, Math.pow(3, a-1));
        else
            Nterm = Math.pow(2, Math.pow(2, a));
        return Nterm;
