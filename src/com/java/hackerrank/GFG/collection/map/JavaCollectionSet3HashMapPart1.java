HashMap is a part of collection in Java. It provides the basic implementation of Map interface of Java. It stores the data in (Key, Value) pairs. To access a value you must know its key, otherwise, you canâ€™t access it. HashMap is known as HashMap because it uses the technique called Hashing. Solve the following problem using a HashMap.

Given two arrays key[] and arr[] of size N and a key s. Each key[i] and arr[i] form a key-value pair. Find if the value of S in the N key-value pairs.



Example 1:

Input: n = 3
keys = {sak, varun, vijay}
arr = {5, 7, 3}
s = sak
Output: 5
Explaination: The key is present in the map.
So its corresponding value is returned which
is 5.
